# Fault-Tolerent-KV-Store

The project is from Assignment 3 of the course CSC469, Fall 2020 instructed by Prof. Angela Demke Brown. It is a fault-tolerant distributed key-value store that consists of multiple key-value servers, each of which is responsible for a portion of the key space (i.e., the range of possible keys).
